# TESSA4QGIS

## Description 

This program represents the excecution of the steps for estimating ecosystem services (ES) within the Intereg Danube Floodplain project [1].

The tool consists of three packages, divided according to the division of the methodologies implemented in the TESSA Toolkit [2]. 
The sections can be run independently and to each of them correspond different files of functions (included in the library).

The sections are named as follows:
- A_Climate_CarbonStorage_TESSA_v*version number*_*study area name*.py
- B_Climate_GHGsequestration_TESSA_v*version number*_*study area name*.py
- C_CultivatedGoods_TESSA_v*version number*_*study area name*.py

The study areas are the following:
- Begecka Jama (Serbia)
- Krka (Slovenia)
- Morava (Czech Republic and Slovakia)

This tool is implemented in python and can be run from QGIS3.

All input data for the Begecka Jama study area are included in this project.

After downloading the zip file, unzip it, and save the new files in a folder named "DanubeFloodplain_ES_Assessment_Tool". Then, create a QGIS3 project and save it in the same path, where the "DanubeFloodplain_ES_Assessment_Tool" folder is located. The program will find the path to run the codes.
